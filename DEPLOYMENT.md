# Deployment Guide for Netlify

## Problem Fixed
The app was crashing when users navigated to routes directly or refreshed pages because Netlify didn't know how to handle client-side routing.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Netlify Redirects Configuration
- **File**: `public/_redirects`
- **Content**: `/*    /index.html   200`
- **Purpose**: Tells Netlify to serve `index.html` for all routes, allowing React Router to handle routing

### 2. Alternative Configuration
- **File**: `netlify.toml`
- **Purpose**: Backup configuration method with build settings

### 3. Error Handling
- Added `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and display errors gracefully
- Added 404 page for undefined routes
- Added catch-all route in React Router

### 4. Build Configuration
- Updated `vite.config.ts` with proper build settings
- Ensured output directory is `dist` (as expected by Netlify)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Either drag and drop the `dist` folder to Netlify
   - Or connect your Git repository and set:
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `dist`

3. **Verify the configuration**:
   - The `_redirects` file should be in the `dist` folder after build
   - All routes should work when accessed directly

## Files Modified/Created

1. `public/_redirects` - Netlify redirect rules
2. `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
3. `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Error handling
4. `src/pages/NotFound.tsx` - 404 page
5. `src/main.tsx` - Added ErrorBoundary wrapper
6. `src/App.tsx` - Added catch-all route and NotFound import
7. `vite.config.ts` - Updated build configuration

## Testing

After deployment, test these scenarios:
1. Navigate to `/dashboard` directly in browser
2. Navigate to `/signin` directly in browser
3. Navigate to `/signup` directly in browser
4. Navigate to a non-existent route like `/invalid-route`
5. Refresh the page on any route

All should work without crashes now!
